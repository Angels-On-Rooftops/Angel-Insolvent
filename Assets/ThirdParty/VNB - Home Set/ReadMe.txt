DETAILS:

The aim for this package is to just set-up things quickly, by providing ready-to-use prefabs of everything. This includes:

- Materials and original color palettes (that are pretty easy to modify).
(if you're using URP, then you will need to convert these to URP)
- Prefabs ready to snap into scene, to be animated or manipulated from script (some are actual ready-to-use compositions of models).

*Make sure to snap things to the grid when using tiles*

*Look at my itch.io page for details*

If you find bugs or any other kind of problem, please contact me on my itch.io page or through discord. I'm always open to any kind of suggestions on what to add or change!

You're free to use every model the way you want for any commercial / non-commercial project. (comments and mentions are always welcome and certainly appreciated)

I shouldn't really need to clarify this, but just in case, remember you're not able to re-sell these models individually or as part of a model pack.

Please make sure to review the asset on itch.io if you found it useful, leave a comment there, along with any kind of suggestion (or problem you faced while using it) in order to improve it!

[Notes]
* Some models may contain a second material, used to add more variation to certain parts of the model itself.
